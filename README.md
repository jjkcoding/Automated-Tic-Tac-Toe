# Automated-Tic-Tac-Toe

Description: This is just like a regular game of tic tac toe, except you are versing a mini artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates 1000 games for every 1 move you do. Although it would be better to just try every move due to the small number of available moves, there are multiple real life situations where it is impossible to attempt every move. This is a mini artificial intelligence program that I could expand to other projects in the future.
